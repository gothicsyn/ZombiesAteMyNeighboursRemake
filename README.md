Aiding them in this task are a variety of weapons and power-ups that can be used to battle the numerous enemies in each level.

Disclaimer

Figured I'd better put this up, considering the state of things these days, this project is in no way affiliated with LucasArts or any of its subsidiaries. Nor is affiliated with Disney nor any of their subsidiaries, who now own LucasArts. This is purely a fan project as we believe this remake is long overdue on what many of us feel one of the greatest games of all time.
